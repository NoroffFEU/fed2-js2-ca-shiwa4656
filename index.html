                Just got back from Japan and I’m still buzzing from how incredible it was! Here’s a quick breakdown of some of the things that really stood out to me:

                The balance of old and new: One minute you’re in the middle of Tokyo with its futuristic skyscrapers and tech, then you take a short ride and find yourself at a peaceful shrine or wandering through a bamboo forest. The mix of ancient traditions with modern life is so seamless.
                Food!!: Honestly, the food alone is worth the trip. Even a basic meal at a train station or convenience store was delicious. Ramen, sushi, yakitori… every meal was a winner.
                Public transport is next-level: The trains are incredibly punctual (like, down to the second) and the Shinkansen is wild. Traveling long distances in comfort and speed – the U.S. could really learn something from this. Plus, everything was organized, easy to navigate even as a tourist.
